1-Reported On

If none of these fields are found in the report, then return today‚Äôs date as the reported date. Assume today is {TODAY_DATE}
save the extracted date as starting date ie 'start_date'.

#Schedule development :
You are an expert at planning communication schedules. You have to use the {start_date} you just extracted and then schedule emails as :
day 1: start_date (same day)
day 3: start_date + 3days
and so on goes : day 7,14,21,30
month 2,3,4,6,9,12 : day 1. Find these dates with refrence to the start_date and keep it as first argument in communication plan csv instead of phrases like 'day 3', 'month 4 day 1' etc.

# Expected result and format guidelines :
Present ONLY the communication plan in an spreadsheet format with attributes : Day, Check-in Topic, Message for Patient. 
Output meal plan ONLY as a pipe-delimited CSV format, without any extra markdown, asterisks or lines. First row should be header, subsequent rows should be data.

When listing multiple points, use a., b., c. as sub-bullet points instead of asterisks or hyphens.

Plan should be structured like :
1st month - day : 1,3,7,14,21
2nd month : 1st day
months : 2,3,4,6,9, 12 : 1st day

Include promotional emails for : International Heart Health Day on September 29th and align the promootional mail in the schedule accordingly.

#Extraction of hospital details and lab details : 

=> Hospital Contact Extraction Logic:
First, scan the report for any explicit hospital phone number, hotline, or appointment number. Look for labels such as:

"Hospital Phone",
"Contact Number",
"Appointment Phone",
"Helpline",
"Customer Care",
"Support",
"Reception",
"Contact Us" section.

If any such phone number is found, extract and save it as Hospital Phone Number.
If no hospital contact number is found in the report, extract the Doctor‚Äôs Name who has signed, recommended, authorized, or is listed as responsible on the report. Look for fields like:
"Reported by",
"Reviewed by",
"Referring Doctor"
"Consultant Name",
"Authorized by".

Use this extracted doctor's name in patient communication instead of hospital phone.
Format: "Please contact Dr. {Doctor_Name} for appointments or follow-up."

=>  Lab Contact & Website Extraction Logic (for follow-up test emails):
Search for any lab-specific booking or contact details in the report.

Extract:
Lab Contact Number
Lab Booking URL or Website
Look for fields such as:
"Lab Contact",
"Lab Helpline",
"Customer Care",
"Book Test",
"Online Booking",

URLs related to lab‚Äôs online booking or portal.
If both are present, extract both.
If not available, skip lab contact, but continue generating the follow-up message template (without inserting broken links or placeholders).

=> General Rules for Extraction:
- You may assume that phone numbers can be recognized as any standard phone number format (country codes, dashes, spaces, parentheses allowed).
- Extract only the first valid contact number or link you find for both hospital and lab.
- If both hospital contact and doctor name are present, always prioritize hospital phone number.
- All extracted contact details must be included in the appropriate email templates wherever hospital or lab contacts are referenced.

2025-03-01|Health Summary & Doctor Consultation|Dear Mr. K Jandial, your recent lab report is ready. It indicates anemia with a high MCV, suggesting a need to investigate potential causes like vitamin deficiencies. Additionally, your eosinophil levels are elevated, which can sometimes be linked to allergies or other conditions. It's important to discuss these findings with your doctor for further evaluation and guidance. Please contact us to schedule your appointment. Hospital Contact: [Hospital Appointment Link] or call [Hospital Phone Number].
2025-03-04|Follow-Up Appointment Reminder|Hello Mr. K Jandial, just a friendly reminder to schedule your doctor's visit this week to discuss your lab results. Understanding the cause of your anemia and elevated eosinophils is an important step towards maintaining your health. Click here to book: [Hospital Appointment Link].
2025-03-08|Dietary Changes for Anemia & Immune Support|Dear Mr. K Jandial, a balanced diet can greatly support your overall health, especially for managing anemia and supporting your immune system. For your conditions, focusing on nutrient-rich and anti-inflammatory foods is beneficial. Here are some tips for an Indian palate: a. For Anemia (Macrocytic): Increase intake of Vitamin B12 and Folate. Include dairy products (milk, paneer, dahi), eggs (if non-vegetarian), lentils (dal), leafy greens (palak, methi), and fortified cereals. These help in red blood cell formation and maturation. b. For Eosinophilia/Immune Support: Focus on anti-inflammatory foods. Use spices like turmeric and ginger. Include fresh fruits and vegetables (berries, citrus, broccoli) for antioxidants. Incorporate healthy fats like flaxseeds and nuts. Consume fermented foods like dahi and chaas for gut health, which is crucial for immunity. c. General: Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive fried items. Stay well-hydrated. These choices help improve blood health and support your body's natural defenses. For more details, you can find general nutrition guidance here: [https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/healthy-eating].
2025-03-15|Exercise for Well-being & Energy|Hello Mr. K Jandial, regular physical activity is key for overall well-being, energy levels, and can help manage stress, which indirectly supports your immune system. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days. Remember to start slowly and gradually increase intensity. Listen to your body and rest when needed. Here's a beginner-friendly weekly plan: a. Workout Days (4 days): Focus on gentle strength and flexibility. Try 1-2 sets of 10 repetitions for each: Chair Squats (sit and stand from a chair, helps leg strength), Wall Push-ups (push against a wall, strengthens upper body), Bicep Curls (with light weights or water bottles, strengthens arms), Leg Raises (lying on your back, lift one leg at a time, strengthens core and legs). b. Mild Cardio Days (3 days): Brisk walking for 30 minutes (improves cardiovascular health and energy), or gentle cycling. c. Rest Days: Allow your body to recover. These exercises are designed to be low-impact and build strength gradually, supporting overall health without overexertion. Find more general exercise guidelines here: [https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm]. For exercise tutorials, search for 'chair squats for seniors' or 'wall push ups' on YouTube from trusted health channels like Mayo Clinic or NHS.
