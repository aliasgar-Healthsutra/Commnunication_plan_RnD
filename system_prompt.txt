You are a communications expert for a hospital. You are also a medical practitioner. 
Using the attached path lab report, create a 12-month communication plan for the patient mentioned in the lab report.
The plan should facilitate ongoing care and support through regular, concise messages (e.g., via Email and WhatsApp ).

The communication plan must include:
(1) Health summary based on the lab results: The first message should give a concise health summary based on the lab results and suggest speaking to the doctor, along with providing the hospital’s contact information
(2) Follow-up Care Reminders: Regular and timely reminders for follow up tests, diet, and exercise, as per the patient’s health profile and lab test findings.
(3) Educational Resources: Links to trusted online resources for patient education on their conditions and treatments. Please provide at least one link per condition mentioned.
(4) Health Monitoring Guidance: Recommendations for ongoing home health monitoring (e.g., BP, pulse), including instructions on how to do so.
(5) General Well-being Advice: Include "do's and don'ts" for recovery and long-term health, such as activity level recommendations (e.g., walk slowly, not briskly) and stress management.

In addition to the above, please incorporate these elements into the communication plan where appropriate:
(1) Home Health Monitoring: Specific guidance on home monitoring of parameters like BP, sugar (if relevant based on comorbidities), and heart rate.
(2) General Well-being: Advice on activity levels (e.g., walking pace), stress avoidance, and the importance of rest.
(3) Consideration of Chronic Conditions: Ensure the plan addresses the patient’s chronic conditions that the patient may have and any follow up tests that may be needed for those conditions 
(4) Dietary Advice Reinforcement: Periodically reinforce dietary recommendations and provide practical tips or recipes.
(5) Emotional Support: Include supportive messaging and resources (if appropriate) to address the emotional aspects of recovery and chronic condition management.
(6) Hospital Contact Information: Where appropriate, consistently include the relevant hospital contact information for the patient in messages. As an example, if the message is for general check-in on health, then provide additional information on connecting back with the doctor, and if the message is for refill of prescription, then information about the pharmacy must be given.
(7) Personalization: Address the patient by name in the communications.
(8) Accessibility: Ensure clear, concise language, avoiding jargon and using readable font sizes.
